*Global Variables:
        Variables declared outside a function or in global space are called global variables.
        These variables can be accessed by any function in the program.
*Local Variables:
        Any variable declared inside a function is known as a local variable.
        This variable is present in the local space and not in the global space.
Q22. Is python case sensitive?

Ans: Comments in Python start with a # character. However, alternatively at times, commenting is done using docstrings(strings enclosed within triple quotes).

Q38. What is pickling and unpickling?
Ans: Pickle module accepts any Python object and converts it into a string
     representation and dumps it into a file by using dump function, this process 
     is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python objects from 
     the stored string representation is called unpickling.

Q39. What are the generators in python?
Ans: Functions that return an iterable set of items are called generators.

Q40. How will you capitalize the first letter of string?
Ans: In Python, the capitalize() method capitalizes the first letter of a string. If the string already consists of a capital letter at the beginning, then, it returns the original string.

Q41. How will you convert a string to all lowercase?
Ans: To convert a string to lowercase, lower() function can be used.

Q44. What is the purpose of ‘is’, ‘not’ and ‘in’ operators?
Ans: Operators are special functions. They take one or more values and produce a corresponding result.
       *is: returns true when 2 operands are true  (Example: “a” is ‘a’)
       *not: returns the inverse of the boolean value
       *in: checks if some element is present in some sequence
Q45. What is the usage of help() and dir() function in Python?
Ans: Help() and dir() both functions are accessible from the Python interpreter and used for viewing a consolidated dump of built-in functions. 
            *Help() function: The help() function is used to display the documentation string and also facilitates you to see the help related to modules, keywords, attributes, etc.
            *Dir() function: The dir() function is used to display the defined symbols.
Q47. What is a dictionary in Python?
Q49. What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it?

Q50. What does len() do?
Ans: It is used to determine the length of a string, a list, an array, etc.
Q51. Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python.

Q53. What are Python packages?
Ans: Python packages are namespaces containing multiple modules.

Q54.How can files be deleted in Python?
Ans: To delete a file in Python, you need to import the OS Module. After that, you need to use the os.remove() function.

Q55. What are the built-in types of python?
Ans: Built-in types in Python are as follows –
          *Integers
          *Floating-point
          *Complex numbers
          *Strings
          *Boolean
          *Built-in functions
Q57. How to add values to a python array?
Ans: Elements can be added to an array using the append(), extend() and the insert (i,x) functions.

Q58. How to remove values to a python array?
Ans: Array elements can be removed using pop() or remove() method. The difference between these two functions is that the former returns the deleted value whereas the latter does not.

      Scikit-learn and many more.

Q64. What is split used for?
Ans:The split() method is used to separate a given String in Python.

Q65. How to import modules in python?
Ans:Modules can be imported using the import keyword.  You can import modules in three ways-
Example:
      *import array           #importing using the original module name
      *import array as arr    # importing using an alias name
      *from array import *    #imports everything present in the array module

Q66. Explain Inheritance in Python with an example.
Ans:They are different types of inheritance supported by Python:
        *Single Inheritance – where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class.
        *Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 in inherited from base class base1, and d2 are inherited from base2.
        *Hierarchical inheritance – from one base class you can inherit any number of child classes
        *Multiple inheritance – a derived class is inherited from more than one base class.

Q68. What is monkey patching in Python?
Ans: In Python, the term monkey patch only refers to dynamic modifications of a class or module at run-time.

Consider the below example:
      # m.py
      class MyClass:
      def f(self):
      print "f()"

Q69. Does python support multiple inheritance?
Ans: Multiple inheritance means that a class can be derived from more than one parent classes. Python does support multiple inheritance, unlike Java.

Q70. What is Polymorphism in Python?

Ans: Encapsulation means binding the code and the data together. A Python class in an example of encapsulation.

Q72. How do you do data abstraction in Python?

Q74. How to create an empty class in Python? 
Ans: An empty class is a class that does not have any code defined within its block. 
     It can be created using the pass keyword. However, you can create objects of this
     class outside the class itself. IN PYTHON THE PASS command does nothing when its 
     executed. it’s a null statement. 

Q75. What does an object() do?
Ans: It returns a featureless object that is a base for all classes. Also, it does not take any parameters.

                         Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) – Python Interview Questions
Q102. Which of the following statements create a dictionary? (Multiple Correct Answers Possible)
a) d = {}
b) d = {“john”:40, “peter”:45}
c) d = {40:”john”, 45:”peter”}
d) d = (40:”john”, 45:”50”)
Answer: b, c & d. 

Dictionaries are created by specifying keys and values.

Q103. Which one of these is floor division?
a) /
b) //
c) %
d) None of the mentioned
Answer: b) //

When both of the operands are integer then python chops out the fraction part and gives you the round off value, to get the accurate answer use floor division. For ex, 5/2 = 2.5 but both of the operands are integer so answer of this expression in python is 2. To get the 2.5 as the answer, use floor division using //. So, 5//2 = 2.5

Q104. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier?
a) 31 characters
b) 63 characters
c) 79 characters
d) None of the above
Answer: d) None of the above

Identifiers can be of any length.

Q105. Why are local variable names beginning with an underscore discouraged?
a) they are used to indicate a private variables of a class
b) they confuse the interpreter
c) they are used to indicate global variables
d) they slow down execution
Answer: a) they are used to indicate a private variable of a class

As Python has no concept of private variables, leading underscores are used to indicate variables that must not be accessed from outside the class.

Q106. Which of the following is an invalid statement?
a) abc = 1,000,000
b) a b c = 1000 2000 3000
c) a,b,c = 1000, 2000, 3000
d) a_b_c = 1,000,000
Answer: b) a b c = 1000 2000 3000

Spaces are not allowed in variable names.

Q107. What is the output of the following?

try:
    if '1' != 1:
        raise "someError"
    else:
        print("someError has not occured")
except "someError":
    print ("someError has occured")
a) someError has occured
b) someError has not occured
c) invalid code
d) none of the above
Answer: c) invalid code

A new exception class must inherit from a BaseException. There is no such inheritance here.

Q108. Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, 25], What is list1[-1] ?
a) Error
b) None
c) 25
d) 2
Answer: c) 25

The index -1 corresponds to the last index in the list.

Q109. To open a file c:scores.txt for writing, we use
a) outfile = open(“c:scores.txt”, “r”)
b) outfile = open(“c:scores.txt”, “w”)
c) outfile = open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “r”)
d) outfile = open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “o”)
Answer: b) The location contains double slashes ( ) and w is used to indicate that file is being written to.

Q110. What is the output of the following?
1

f = None
 
for i in range (5):
    with open("data.txt", "w") as f:
        if (i > 2):
            break
 
print f.closed
a) True
b) False
c) None
d) Error
Answer: a) True 

The WITH statement when used with open file guarantees that the file object is closed when the with block exits.

Q111. When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?
a) always
b) when an exception occurs
c) when no exception occurs
d) when an exception occurs into except block
Answer: c) when no exception occurs
